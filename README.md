# GILES

GILES is designed to help software engineers quickly identify
[side channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack)
security risks during development stages.

This tool simulates instruction-level
[side channel analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack)
leakage without the need for anything other that a target program by simulating
a processor and gathering leakage traces from this simulated processor.

It can support multiple different processors and multiple different methods of 
generating leakage from these.
Currently the only supported simulator is the
[Thumb Timing Simulator](https://github.com/bristol-sca/thumb-sim).
This will simulate an
[ARM Cortex M0 processor.](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0)
The [supported leakage models can be found here.](#leakage-generation-models)

Please feel free to add more simulators and models!
There will be documents describing how to do this at some point.

## Usage

1) **[Download from the releases page](https://github.com/bristol-sca/GILES/releases)**
Alternatively, [build it yourself](#building).

2) **Compile your target program for your chosen simulator.**
Currently only one simulator is supported,
[Thumb Timing Simulator](https://github.com/bristol-sca/thumb-sim),
so compile for this simulator for now.
[Here is an example](https://github.com/bristol-sca/thumb-sim/tree/master/example)
to help you get started.

It is heavily recommended (but not essential) that you make use of the
`elmo-funcs.h` file to provide useful functions, such as trigger points and the
ability to get random data inside the simulator. This can be 
[found on the releases page.](https://github.com/bristol-sca/GILES/releases)


The target program should be edited to replace the target
data, such as the cryptographic key, with randomly generated values.

3) **Run GILES.**
Here is an example of the most common usage.
```
./GILES my-program-binary-from-step-2 -o output-file.trs
```
Note that this requires the file coeffs.json to be in the same directory.
This can be overridden like so:
```
./GILES my-program-binary-from-step-2 some-path/coeffs.json -o output-file.trs
```

4) Done! Perform whatever side channel attacks/analysis you want on the
[output file.](#output-format)

## All command line options
All command line options can be printed using the -h or --help flags shown here:
```
./GILES --help
```
This should produce the result below.

Usage:
  bin/GILES [OPTION...] [--input] EXECUTABLE [--file] COEFFICIENTS

  -h, --help                    Print help
  -r, --runs N                  Number of traces to generate (default: 1)
  -f, --file COEFFICIENTS       Coefficients file (default: ./coeffs.json)
  -i, --input EXECUTABLE        Executable to be ran in the simulator
  -o, --output FILE             Generated traces output file
  -s, --simulator SIMULATOR NAME
                                The name of the simulator that should be used
                                (default: Andres)
  -m, --model MODEL NAME        The name of the mathematical model that
                                should be used to generate traces (default: Hamming
                                Weight)
```

## Leakage generation models

There are currently two methods supported for generating leakage supported.

### ELMO Power model

This is the recommend model for generating high quality leakage.

[Details of how it works can be found here.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/mccann)

### Hamming weight model

This is the default model and will generate leakage much faster but the
leakage may not be as high quality.

This works by taking the
[Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)
of the operands of the instructions executed.

### Others

Please help add more if you can!
There will be a document describing how to do this at some point.

## Output format

GILES currently saves traces in the `.trs` format.
This format is designed for use in
[Riscure's Inspector](https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-sca/),
but can be interpreted in
[other ways](https://github.com/Riscure/python-trsfile).

We hope to support alternative formats in the future.

## API Documentation

Documentation is generated using
[Doxygen.](http://www.doxygen.nl/) In order to generate this
follow these instructions:

1) [**Install Doxygen**](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)

2) Firstly follow the instructions in the
[**Getting started for Development section.**](BUILDING.md#getting-started-for-development)

3) Documentation can be built with CMake using the "doc" target by **running the
command as shown.**
```
cmake --build . --target doc
```

4) **Open this file**
```
/path/to/build/directory/doc/html/index.html
```

Additionally, enabling the cmake configuration option
`GILES_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION` will generate the documentation every
time you compile.
